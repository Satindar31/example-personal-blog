This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
You can demo it at [https://example-personal-blog.vercel.app/](https://example-personal-blog.vercel.app/)


## Getting Started
First clone the repo with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/satindar31/example-personal-blog.git
```
Then copy the enviorment variables from .env.example to .env.local using 
```bash
cp .env.example > .env.local
```
You can then install the packages with
```bash
npm install

# or
yarn add

#or
pnpm add
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
